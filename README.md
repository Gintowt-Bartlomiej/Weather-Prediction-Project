# PGM Project – Weather Prediction

## Author

As part of the **Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM)** course project, I focused on the task of **weather prediction**.  
The goal was to compare the methods studied during the labs with alternative approaches used for similar predictive tasks.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset: [Weather Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muthuj7/weather-dataset?resource=download).  
2. Place the dataset inside the `data/` directory.  
3. Start with the exploratory data analysis by running the `EDA.ipynb` notebook.  

The implemented models can be found in the `models/` directory.  
Each model can be executed by opening and running its corresponding notebook.

## Report
A detailed description of the project and results is available in the file: `raport.pdf`.
